README for DevHelp.

The following packages are required to compile DevHelp:

GTK+ 2.2.0 (or greater)
gnome-vfs 2.0 (or greater)
libgnomeui 2.2.0 (or greater)

Also either gtkhtml2 (2.1.2 or greater) or a recent Mozilla (built
with GTK+ 2). The default HTML viewer component in gtkhtml, to use
Mozilla pass --with-html-widget=mozilla to configure.

Book management has been totally rewritten since DevHelp 0.4.  From the user's
point of view, the Add Book menu item has been removed as it is not needed any
more.

DevHelp's primary goal is to be an API documentation browser for GNOME.  When
you build (or install) a GNOME library, it will build an API reference for you
and install it into $PREFIX/gtk-doc/html/$PACKAGE.  Along with the HTML files, a
.devhelp file is also generated automatically -- no post-processing has to be
done.  Thus DevHelp can simply scan that folder for .devhelp files and display
them.  For other documentation, there is also $PREFIX/share/devhelp/books and
$HOME/.devhelp/books which are scanned. These locations are ideal for system-
and user-wide non-GTK+ books.

The complete list of locations searched for books is:

$DEVHELP_SEARCH_PATH
   ex $DEVHELP_SEARCH_PATH/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

$GNOME2_PATH:
   ex $GNOME2_PATH/share/devhelp/books/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

$PREFIX/share/gtk-doc/html ($PREFIX=where you install devhelp),
   ex /opt/gnome2/share/gtk-doc/html/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

/usr/share/gtk-doc/html
   ex /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

$PREFIX/share/devhelp/books
   ex /opt/gnome2/share/devhelp/books/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

$HOME/.devhelp/books
   ex /home/ross/.devhelp/books/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

Note that the name of the directory the .devhelp file is in, and the name of the
.devhelp file (minus the extension) must match.  There is a DTD available in
dtd/devhelp-1.dtd which can be used to validate books.  Note that there have
been several minor changes to the format which break the older books: the base
attribute is actually respected, the only valid child of <chapters> is <sub>,
and the author attribute has been removed.
