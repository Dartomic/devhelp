Devhelp information
===================

The following packages are required to compile Devhelp:

gtk+ 2.6.0 (or greater)
libglade 2.4.0 (or greater)
libwnck 2.10.0 (or greater)
gconf 2.6.0 (or greater)

Also required is a version of the Gecko HTML engine, either supplied
by mozilla, firefox, thunderbird or xulrunner.

Devhelp's primary goal is to be an API documentation browser for
GNOME.  When you build (or install) a GNOME library, it will build an
API reference for you and install it into
$PREFIX/gtk-doc/html/$PACKAGE.  Along with the HTML files, a .devhelp
and/or .devhelp2 file is also generated automatically. Thus Devhelp
can simply scan that folder for .devhelp files and display them. For
other documentation, there is also $PREFIX/share/devhelp/books and
$HOME/.devhelp/books which are scanned.  These locations are useful
for system- and user-wide non-GTK+ books.

The complete list of locations searched for books is:

$DEVHELP_SEARCH_PATH
   e.g. $DEVHELP_SEARCH_PATH/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

$GNOME2_PATH:
   e.g. $GNOME2_PATH/share/devhelp/books/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

$PREFIX/share/gtk-doc/html ($PREFIX=where you install devhelp),
   e.g. /opt/gnome2/share/gtk-doc/html/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

/usr/share/gtk-doc/html
   e.g. /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

$PREFIX/share/devhelp/books
   e.g. /opt/gnome2/share/devhelp/books/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

$HOME/.devhelp/books
   e.g. /home/ross/.devhelp/books/glib-2.0/glib-2.0.devhelp

Note that the name of the directory the .devhelp file is in, and the
name of the .devhelp file (minus the extension) must match. There is a
DTD available in dtd/devhelp-1.dtd which can be used to validate
books. Note that there have been several minor changes to the format
which break the older books: the base attribute is actually respected,
the only valid child of <chapters> is <sub>, and the author attribute
has been removed.
