1: Build & Installations
========================

The following packages are required to compile DevHelp:

Name            Version (at least)
----            ------------------
GLib            1.2.9
GTK+            1.2.9
LibXML          1.8.10
GnomeVFS        1.0.0
ORBit           0.5.7
Gnome-libs      1.2.8
GConf           0.12
GtkHTML         0.10.0
Gnome-print     0.29

You could probably use older version of the packages, but
it's untested.

If you want to live on the bleeding edge, here is how you
retrive the latest cvs:

$ export CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome'
(or setenv for csh/tcsh users)

$ cvs -z3 co devhelp

Use autogen.sh to generate configure and use the configure script 
to create Makefiles, if you pass the option --help you'll get 
a list of supported paramters. 

See the INSTALL file for futher instructions.

Now type:
make
followed by
make install

To start DevHelp just type:
devhelp

==========================
2: Books
==========================

So you want something to read?

Go to DevHelps homepage: http://devhelp.codefactory.se/
and you'll find a list of books.

Once you downloaded a book either a .devhelp (sometimes called spec) or a
.tar.gz (full book).
Start up DevHelp and choose File -> Add book.
Tada.
The book should pop up in the book list.
