 * @Short_description: Builds #DhSettings objects
 *
 * #DhSettingsBuilder permits to build #DhSettings objects. Once a #DhSettings
 * object is created, it is immutable.
 *
 * The #GSettings schemas installed by the libdevhelp are relocatable. So the
 * paths need to be provided.

/* API design:
 *
 * Follow the builder pattern, see:
 * https://blogs.gnome.org/otte/2018/02/03/builders/
 * but implement it in a simpler way, to have less boilerplate.
