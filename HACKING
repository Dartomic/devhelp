C code conventions
------------------

Devhelp follows the Linux kernel coding style, with some exceptions:
- Indentation: 8 spaces, not tabs.
- One space before *each* opening parenthesis.
- Multi-line comments must be like this:
        /* First line.
         * Second line.
         */

GObject classes must not be created with a G_DECLARE macro, it causes more
problems than it solves:
