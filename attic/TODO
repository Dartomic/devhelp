TODO Devhelp attic
==================

Triage the files, remove what is no longer needed, and better document what is
still useful (if it's still useful it can be moved to another directory).

For describing the index file format, a *.rng file would be better. The
devhelp-1.dtd seems to describe the index file format version 1, which is
deprecated. What are the other *.dtd files?
