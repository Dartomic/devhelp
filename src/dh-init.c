 * dh_free_resources:
 *
 * Free the resources allocated by Devhelp. For example it unrefs the singleton
 * objects.
 *
 * It is not mandatory to call this function, it's just to be friendlier to
 * memory debugging tools. This function is meant to be called at the end of
 * main().
 *
 * Since: 3.26
 */

/* Another way is to use a DSO destructor, see gconstructor.h in GLib.
 *
 * The advantage of calling dh_free_resources() at the end of main() is that
 * gobject-list [1] correctly reports that all Dh* objects have been finalized
 * when quitting the application. On the other hand a DSO destructor runs after
 * the gobject-list's last output, so it's much less convenient, see:
